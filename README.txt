This program is a simulated linked list in Java.

The main goals for this program are:
Completed: User can input data.
Completed: The data functions as a linked list.
Changed: User can navigate through the list.
Completed: The data is transcribed to a text file.
Completed: Text files are read every program start.
Completed: Text files remain after program termination.

The start date is March 15, 2017.
The completion date is March 15, 2017.

The requirement for the user navigation was changed to be:
Completed: Users can add to before the head of the list.
Completed: Users can add to after the tail of the list.
Completed: Users can add before and after an index on the list.
Completed: Users remove an index on the list.

This offers more functionality than simply being able to traverse through the nodes of the list one by one.


Possible improvements in the future:
Refactoring.
Unit tests.
GUI instead of command line.
